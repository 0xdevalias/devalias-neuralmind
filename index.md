# /dev/alias &ndash; Neural Mind

This site is a neural dumping ground, a collection of random information, thoughts, musings, links and any other related data that needs a structured home somewhere outside of my mind.

Warning! This information may be unstructured, weird, random, confusing, or just plain boring. You get that. Welcome to my mind, or at least this part of it..
