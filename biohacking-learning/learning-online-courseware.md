# Learning through Online Courseware/MOOC's

* "A Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. In addition to traditional course materials such as videos, readings, and problem sets, MOOCs provide interactive user fora that help build a community for students, professors, and teaching assistants (TAs). MOOCs are a recent development in distance education." &ndash; [Massive Open Online Course (Wiki)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)
